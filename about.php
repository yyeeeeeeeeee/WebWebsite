            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>Our vision is to expand our shelterâ€™s capacity to rescue more animals and rehome them. 
                We aim to do more for the stray animals to give them another chance at a better life. 
                We have saved, vaccinated, sterilised and rehomed over a thousand stray animals since we began our rescuing efforts. 
                Ultimately, we are striving to curb negligence towards stray animals as well as control the stray population in our community. 
                We still lack the resources and capacity to accommodate for our increasing number of rescues as we are an independent organisation. 
                Nevertheless, we will continue to persevere in our efforts to help more animals in need and to carry out our work with compassion and integrity.
