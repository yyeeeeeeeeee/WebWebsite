					<strong>Pets Listings</strong>
					<p><i>For Adoption:</i> Only pets that are genuinely for adoption may be listed here. 
						Pets for sale cannot be listed under this status. 
						Adopters may not adopt a pet with the intention of reselling it.</p>
                    <p><i>For Sale:</i> All pets for sale must contain photo, price and contact number.
                         You may not list items/products for sale here.</p>
                    <p><i>Lost:</i> This section is for listing pets that are Lost.
                         If you have recovered your pet subsequently, 
                         please change the status to Owner's Pet accordingly.</p>
                    <p><i>Found:</i> This section is for listing pets that are Found, where the rightful owner is being sought after.
                         If you managed to find its actual owner thereafter, 
                        you can either change its status to Owner's Pet or just deactivate it.</p>
                    <p>You may not intentionally refresh your pet profile for the sole purpose of updating it to the front of the pet listings.
                         This is considered an abuse of the system and profiles in violation will be removed.</p>
                    <p>PawsomeAdopt reserves the right to remove any listings deemed inaccurate or in violation of terms without prior notice,
                         and the violating account may be blacklisted.</p>
